# HTML-CSS-Mini-Project

The project includes a web page written in html whose layout was designed through CSS. The project mainly involves the use of flex-box to create containers and align the content within them according to the requirements. Further I have used <div> tags to further divide the content. Most of the tags are selected using class selectors to style them with css properties.
